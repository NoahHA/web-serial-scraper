# PDF generator for web serials

This project generates PDFs containing the text for the popular web novel Mother of Learning by Domagoj Kurmaic. I used Selenium to web scrape the chapter text and FPDF to generate the PDFs.

The reason I made this project was so that I could read offline when travelling or without internet connection. I also didn't like the look of the website and preferred to read it from a PDF.

I do not own the rights to this novel and you are not legally allowed to sell copies of it. The writer has given permission to create personal copies though so feel free to use the code for yourself.
